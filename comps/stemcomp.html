                to
                showcase their research and problem-solving skills in addressing pressing global challenges.
                Participants will chose a question, perform scientific research, and propose an innovative solution,
                showcasing their findings through visual media. The competition is organised jointy by the <a

                            <p>
                                The first step in a strong submission is choosing the right problem. Some problems are big and urgent, but already receive a lot of attention. Others might be solvable but don’t affect that many people. To help you think carefully, we encourage you to use the ITN framework:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Importance: How big is the problem? How many lives or how much of the planet does it affect?</li>
                                    <li>Tractability: How solvable is it? Could extra effort or resources actually make progress?</li>
                                    <li>Neglectedness: How many people are already working on this? If very few, your idea might have more impact.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Your submission should explain the problem you’ve chosen and why it matters, drawing
                                on these ITN considerations. This will help judges see that you’ve thought about scale
                                and impact, not just a familiar or comfortable issue. Below are some links for you
                                    to get inspiration about current issues:</p>
